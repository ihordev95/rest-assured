Change log next version
-----------------------
* Added support for specifying base path using "RestAssured.basePath = /resource". E.g. let's say that the base URI is http://localhost and base path is "/resource" will make create a request to "http://localhost/resource/something" when doing a 'get("/something")'. Default value is empty. (issue 13)
* Support for specifying request/query parameters in the url, e.g. get("/something?param1=first&param2=second"). (issue 23)
* Fixed a bug in RestAssuredResponse parser that caused a NPE when the input stream was null. (issue 25)
* Major improvements to XML expecations. It now uses Groovy evaluation of the expectation string to allow for much better expectations.
* Support for expecting on XML attributes, e.g. expect().body("greeting.name.@firstName", equalTo("John")).when().get("/greetXMLAttribute?firstName=John&lastName=Doe");


Change 1.0.3 (2011-01-17)
-------------------------
* Fixed a bug in the JSON parsing which prevent parsing of nested arrays (issue 15)
* Added support for getting an index in a JSON array. E.g. expect().body("items.get(0)", equalTo("firstIndex")).when().get("/something");. Assuming that "items" is an array then "items.get(0)" returns the first element in that array.
* Fixed so that you can expect on null values in JSON arrays.
* Request senders can now return the body as byte array or string. E.g. get("/something").asString() makes GET request to "/something" and returns the response body as a string. This is useful if you want to debug the response while creating your test or if you want to use third-party tools to validate the response. Note that it only works if you don't specify any expectations before making the request.

Change log 1.0.2 (2011-01-12)
-----------------------------
* JSON and XML matching now supports many more content types than before. Before you could only use XML matching for content type application/xml and JSON for application/json.
* Support for HTML verification
* Support for RSS verification (content type application/rss+xml)

Change log 1.0.1 (2010-12-27)
-----------------------------
* Refactored AuthenticationSpecification to be a Java interface in order to avoid Groovy methods being exposed and to allow for Javadoc.
